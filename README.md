An object-oriented programming language taking C as a base (this isn't made in C btw)


## What's the purpose of this?
This was made with the purpose of making an easy programming language but also making a complete one, you could say i tried making C easier to read and write

## For what is this being used?
Many things, like my apps, games and general things

## Is this language console-only?
No, with the time i will make it compatible with Qt5, SDL2, and many more GUI builders

### Arrival:
 2026 (by now the source is public for you to help me fix things of this language :))
